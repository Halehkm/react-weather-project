# Weather App-React

Click here to deploy: https://zen-galileo-53d393.netlify.app/

## Project Description 

This was my first coding project using react! As with learning anything new, there were challenges and frustrations. However, I worked through them and was able to produce this application. 

## Criteria

I was asked to re-build my weather app using react with a search engine and API integration hosted on Netlify. Since I had already built this app using JavaScript, there were parts that came easily. However, learning how to use the components and Usesates made it seem as though this was a new project. I would say this was easier to build since I already had a road map, it was just a matter of learning a different way to display the information. I really enjoyed using react!
